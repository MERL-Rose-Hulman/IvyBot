# IvyBot Bottom with Holder Assembly

This assembly consists of the IvyBot Bottom and four Servo Holders. The files required for this assembly are organized into two folders: STL files and SolidWorks files.

## Folder Structure

- `STL/`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - IvyBot Bottom-1.STL`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-2.STL`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-4.STL`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-5.STL`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-6.STL`
  
- `SolidWorks/`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder.SLDPRT`
  - `IvyBot Bottom.SLDPRT`
  - `Servo Holder.SLDPRT`

## Components

### IvyBot Bottom
The main base of the IvyBot, designed to hold various components and provide structural support.

- **File**: `IvyBot Bottom.SLDPRT`
- **STL File**: `IvyBot Bottom with holder - IvyBot Bottom-1.STL`

### Servo Holder
Holders designed to mount servos securely to the IvyBot Bottom. Four servo holders are used in this assembly.

- **File**: `Servo Holder.SLDPRT`
- **STL Files**:
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-2.STL`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-4.STL`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-5.STL`
  - `IvyBot Bottom with holder - Servo Holder-6.STL`

## Assembly Instructions

1. **Prepare the IvyBot Bottom**: Print the IvyBot Bottom using the STL file `IvyBot Bottom with holder - IvyBot Bottom-1.STL`.
2. **Prepare the Servo Holders**: Print four Servo Holders using the STL files provided.
3. **Assemble the Servo Holders to the IvyBot Bottom**: Attach the four Servo Holders to the IvyBot Bottom as per the design in the SolidWorks assembly file `IvyBot Bottom with holder.SLDPRT`.
4. **Finalize Assembly**: Ensure all components are securely mounted and aligned as per the design specifications.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure all parts are printed with the correct orientation and settings for optimal fit and strength.
- Verify that all servo holders are aligned properly to avoid any mechanical issues during operation.

This assembly provides a robust and modular design for the IvyBot, allowing easy integration and maintenance of servo motors.
